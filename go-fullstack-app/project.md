### Backend (Go + MongoDB)

1. **Set Up MongoDB**
   - Install MongoDB on your local machine or set up a cloud-based MongoDB instance.
   - Create a new database and collections.

2. **Create a New Go Project**
   - Initialize a new Go module: `go mod init <module_name>`
   - Add necessary dependencies such as `mongo-go-driver` for interacting with MongoDB.

3. **Database Connection**
   - Establish a connection to your MongoDB database.
   - Define models and schemas for storing user data, workouts, etc.

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Create endpoints for:
     - User Authentication (Login/Register)
     - Workout Data (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
     - Graph Data (Fetch progress over time)

5. **Middleware**
   - Implement middleware for authentication and authorization.
   - Use Gorilla Mux or other routers to handle HTTP requests.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling to return meaningful HTTP responses.

7. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for your API endpoints.
   - Use testing tools like `testing` package in Go.

### Frontend (React)

1. **Set Up React Project**
   - Create a new React application: `npx create-react-app <app_name>`
   - Install necessary dependencies such as Axios for HTTP requests, Material-UI for UI components, and Chart.js for generating graphs.

2. **User Authentication**
   - Implement login and registration forms.
   - Use Axios to make API calls to the backend for authentication.

3. **Workout Input Form**
   - Create a form for users to input workout data (picture, weight, reps).
   - Use Axios to send this data to the backend.

4. **Fetching Workout Data**
   - Implement a component to fetch and display past week's workouts.
   - Use Axios to make GET requests to the backend.

5. **Graph Generation**
   - Use Chart.js or another library to generate progress graphs.
   - Fetch historical data from the backend and plot it on the graph.

6. **State Management**
   - Use React Context or Redux for state management if needed.
   - Store user authentication state and workout data.

7. **Styling**
   - Apply Material-UI components for a modern UI.
   - Ensure responsiveness across different devices.

### Deployment

1. **Backend**
   - Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku) to deploy your Go backend.
   - Configure environment variables and database connection strings.
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines if necessary.

2. **Frontend**
   - Build the React application: `npm run build`
   - Deploy the built static files to a web server or a cloud-based hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

### Testing

1. **Backend**
   - Run all unit tests and ensure they pass.
   - Perform integration testing to verify API endpoints.

2. **Frontend**
   - Write unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library.
   - Perform end-to-end testing using tools like Cypress or Puppeteer.
