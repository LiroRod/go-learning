While there's no one "right" way to structure a Go stack, I'll provide you with a popular and widely-used combination for building full-stack web
applications:

**Frontend:**

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Redux** (optional): A state management library to help manage application-wide state.
* **WebAssembly** (optional): For using Go code in the frontend, you can use WebAssembly libraries like `wasmgo` or `wasmtago`.

However, a more common approach is to separate the frontend from the backend and use a different technology for building the client-side UI.

**Backend:**

* **Go**: As your language of choice.
* **Gin**: A high-performance HTTP framework that's popular among Go developers. (Other options like Revel or RevelKit exist as well.)
* **GORM**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with databases in Go.

**Database:**

* **PostgreSQL**: A popular open-source relational database.
* **MySQL**: Another widely-used relational database (you can also use other databases like SQLite, MongoDB, etc.).

**API Design:**

* **RESTful API**: Use the standard REST architecture style to design your APIs. This will make it easier for clients (e.g., React apps) to
consume your services.

**Additional Tools and Libraries:**

* **Go modules**: Use Go's built-in module system for dependency management.
* **Docker**: Containerize your application to ensure consistent deployment across environments.
* **Jenkins or other CI/CD tools**: Automate testing, building, and deployment of your application.

This is a common stack used in many production applications. Feel free to adjust it based on your specific needs and preferences!

Example code structure:
```markdown
# Project Structure

web/
client/
...
server/
main.go
models/
...
routes/
...
db/
...
go.mod
Dockerfile
jenkinsfile
```
In this example:

* `web/client/` contains the frontend code (e.g., React app).
* `web/server/` contains the backend code written in Go.
* `db/` holds the database configuration and schema definitions.

Note that you can adjust this structure to suit your project's requirements.

>>> a go stack with react tho
Here's a popular combination of technologies for building a full-stack web application using Go as the backend language, and React as the
frontend framework:

**Backend:**

* **Go**: As your language of choice.
* **Gin**: A high-performance HTTP framework that's popular among Go developers. (Other options like Revel or Beego exist as well.)
* **GORM**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with databases in Go.

**Database:**

* **PostgreSQL**: A popular open-source relational database.
* **MySQL**: Another widely-used relational database (you can also use other databases like SQLite, MongoDB, etc.).

**Frontend:**

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Redux**: A state management library to help manage application-wide state.
* **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.

**API Design:**

* **RESTful API**: Use the standard REST architecture style to design your APIs. This will make it easier for clients (e.g., React apps) to
consume your services.

**Communication between Go Backend and React Frontend:**

* **gRPC**: A high-performance RPC framework that's gaining popularity in the industry.
* **RESTful API**: Use a standard RESTful API to communicate between your Go backend and React frontend. This is a simpler approach than using
gRPC.

Here's an example of how you can structure your project:

```markdown
# Project Structure

go/
main.go
models/
...
routes/
...
db/
...

web/
client/
public/
index.html
src/
components/
...
containers/
...
utils/
...
actions.js
reducers.js
store.js
App.js
index.js
package.json
yarn.lock
```

In this example:

* `go/` contains the Go backend code.
* `web/client/` contains the React frontend code.

To communicate between your Go backend and React frontend, you can use RESTful API or gRPC. You'll need to create a service that exposes
endpoints for interacting with your database. Then, in your React app, you can make HTTP requests (or gRPC calls) to these endpoints to retrieve
data.

For example, if you have a `User` model in your Go backend, and you want to display a list of users in your React frontend, you can create an
endpoint in your Go service that returns a JSON response with the user data. Then, in your React app, you can make an HTTP request to this
endpoint using the `fetch` API or a library like Axios.

This is just one possible way to structure your project. Depending on your specific needs and requirements, you may need to adjust this approach.
